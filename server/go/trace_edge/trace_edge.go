// Package traceedge provides types and methods for defining edges embedded
// within over-time traces (or within any structured data supporting payloads
// and with a time axis.)  Edge endpoints are attached to payload-bearing Datums
// using New() or AttachNew(), providing a parent object (e.g., a span); an
// offset, a unique string identifier, and zero or more endpoint identifiers
// which are  connected with edges to this endpoint.  For example,
//
//	edgeNode := New(traceSpan, 100 * time.Millisecond, "1", "2", "3")
//
// attaches an edge endpoint named '1' under traceSpan at a trace offset of
// 100ms, and adds two edges, one from '1' to '2' and one from '1' to '3'.
// Properties may then be attached to the edge as usual:
//
//	edgeNode.With(color.Stroke("blue")
//
// In the context of traces, edges provide a way to indicate inter-category
// relationships, such as causal event predecessors or critical paths.
