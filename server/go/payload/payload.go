// Package payload facilitates attaching payloads of arbitrary data to elements
// in structured TraceViz data responses.
//
// There are many structured TraceViz response types, such as tree, tabular,
// and trace data.  In such structured types, some element types (for example,
// nodes in trees, cells in tables, and spans or subspans in traces) can host
// further structured data (but not necessarily following the structure of the
// host element) within them.  Some examples:
//
// *   A table cell containing a histogram;
// *   A trace span containing an overtime xy chart;
// *   A tree node divided into differently-colored regions.
//
// This package facilitates embedding structured data within other structured
// data in this way.  Any type into which other structured data may be embedded
// should implement the Payloader interface.

	// TypeKey, if present in a Datum's properties, indicates that that datum is
	// an embedded payload.  properties[TypeKey] should be a string value
	// indicating the type of the payload; each embeddable structured type
	// should export a unique payload type string.
	TypeKey = "payload_type"
