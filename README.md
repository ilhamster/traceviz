# Welcome to TraceViz!

TraceViz is a platform for building performance analysis tools -- despite the
name, it's not limited to traces :) Compared to traditional approaches to
tool-building, TraceViz tools tend to be more composable, reusable,
maintainable, scalable, and responsive.  TraceViz also supports rapid
prototyping, and provides a clean pathway to productionize prototypes.

TraceViz builds web-based tools with active backends: a tool's backend is always
available to serve user queries, even in response to user interactions.  That
means that the frontend doesn't need to understand the *semantics* of the data
it's displaying, and instead can focus on providing views and supporting user
interactions in a highly reusable, low-semantic way.

TraceViz is suitable for a wide variety of performance tooling applications, but
is especially suitable when building visualizations for rich data, which may
support many different
[*analysis workflows*](./docs/why_traceviz.md#analysis-workflows).

## Development toolchain

TraceViz pins its Node.js version in `.nvmrc` and its pnpm version in
`package.json`. From the repository root, prepare that toolchain and install the
workspace dependencies with:

```sh
nvm install
nvm use
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Using the repository pins avoids Corepack selecting a pnpm release that is
incompatible with the active Node.js version.
